# Ephemera

This is a cli tool I developed to help grade assignments for the Software Development
program I TA'd for. It works with .zip, .tar.gz, and git repositories.
It creates a temporary directory and starts a new shell instance.
You can install dependencies, run the project, do whatever it is needed to grade the
project. Once you're done, you can type `exit` to exit the new shell instance
and it will also delete the temporary directory and project files.

## Installation

Make sure you install Go, then clone the repository and run `go build`.

## Use
